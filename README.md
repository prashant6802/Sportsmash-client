## Elo Rating Algorithm

The Elo rating algorithm, widely used in chess, is employed to calculate and update the ratings of footballers based on user votes. It ensures that the ratings are adjusted dynamically as users vote, reflecting the true preferences of the community.

## Project Inspiration

This project is inspired by the concept of the "Facemash" website depicted in the movie "The Social Network," a biopic of Mark Zuckerberg. We've adapted the idea to create a fun and engaging platform for football enthusiasts to compare their favorite players.

1. Clone this repository and the [Sportsmash-server](https://github.com/prashant6802/Sportsmash-server) repository and put them in a single folder.
